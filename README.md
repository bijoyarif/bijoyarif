CaT_simulator

ï»¿The initiative of CaT simulator came to my mind while I was working on MS in Computer Science in thesis equivalent project to develop a grammar-based white box testing tool. Initially, I have plan to make a tool which can do full-fledged white box testing. I have written my proposal on mutants based software testing tool using B-prolog. Eventually, I gave up my idea to use B-prolog in fear of I could not finish my work in a timely manner, but that was the one of biggest mistakes in my software development career so far.  I believe if I would use B-prolog then I could have finished much earlier. Somehow, I have been compelled to use SWI-prolog which was much familiar to me and it took much longer to finish the whole project, only thing I could deserve is a deep sigh.             

Motivated by the work of Bjarne Stroustrop's simulator on developing C++ while working in Bell labs to incorporate B with Simula, a well-established object oriented programming language.

All the modules in simulator are written using the standard first order logic clause or definite clause grammar (DCG). I have also written a module for depicting the control flow of execution in dot language. I believe there is some buffer overflow problems in the code, otherwise all other modules are well-written, thoroughly checked and can simulate the syntactic and semantic constructs. The structure of my simulator is given below:

(i) scanner ---> final_scanner.pl, {Prolog}
(ii) parser ---> java_mini_parser.pl,{DCG}
(iii) controlflow ---> java_flow.pl, {Prolog}

The module given below is associated with the project of grammar-based white box testing. It can convert the semantic constructs to grammar. It is like a reverse process of conventional simulator or compiler; because the initiative of work is based on making a bridge between Mid-Low level abstraction of computer languages.   

(iv) preprocessor ---> java_processor.pl, {Prolog}   
(v) grammargenerator ---> java_grammar.pl, {Prolog}
(*) diagramcreator ---> dot.pl, {prolog}.     

During my MS years in UNO, I have faced intentional and unintentional trespassing in my project, hence, I could not guarantee that my simulator is bug-free and you have to use it at your own risk.
